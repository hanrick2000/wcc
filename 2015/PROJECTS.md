Some random ideas for projects for WCC 2015. List will be updated as and when required.

## Sandbox to run a binary securely

This would involve all the POSIX APIs to implement a secure environment to run any user submitted binary. It should be able to place customizable limits on CPU time, memory usage, IO operations, etc. Few use cases would be to run user submitted codes on online judges or AI games. It could also be used for loading dynamic libraries in a secure sandbox.

## 2D Game Engine

A 2D game engine, that has knowledge about sprites, objects and backgrounds. It expose simple APIs for setting up the game loop, getting keyboard or mouse events, animations, sound and collision detection. Many may prefer Java for this, but any language can be used. For further exploration and learning take a look into how you can improve your game engine to use OpenGL to draw stuff on screen.
